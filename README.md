# Fake News Detection

Authors: Barat Narcis, Chira Mihaela, Martonca Daniel, Cana Ana, Gradinariu Florin

## Motivation and Statement
Nowadays, distinguishing between real and fake news has become a challenging task. But it can be achieved using machine learning concepts and algorithms. Fake news detection is one of the most interesting and easy machine learning project ideas well suited for beginners.

Within this project, you need to develop a model that can differentiate between real and fake news. You can use [this](https://www.kaggle.com/clmentbisaillon/fake-and-real-news-dataset) dataset to train the Machine Learning model.

Having previous knowledge of Natural Language Processing (NLP) concepts and classification algorithms in machine learning is beneficial for this project. If so, this project will only take a few hours.

This project will also improve your machine learning algorithm and NLP knowledge.
